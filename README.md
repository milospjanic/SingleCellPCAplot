# SingleCellPCAplot

SingleCellPCAplot is an R script that performs principal component analysis of single cell RNAseq data and outputs a PCA plot with a single gene expression presented in a gradiant scale. SingleCellPCAplot takes the mastertable with RPKM values from a single cell RNAseq experiment and it also requires an input parameter, i.e. a gene of interest which expression will be presented as a color gradient. The script will perform principal component analysis and output a scatter plot of PC1/PC2 and PC2/PC3.
